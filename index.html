    <b><p style = "font-size:22px">My Notes from "The Basics of the Web and HTML"</p></b>

<b><p style = "font-size:18px">The Fundamentals</p></b>
The world wide web is, fundamentally, a collection of approximately <b>30 billion</b> individual web pages and has been around since the 1990s. Each of these pages is <b>written in HTML</b> (discussed in more detail below) and is <b>connected to other pages by links</b>. To navigate the web, a user's browser on their computer sends an HTTP request to a server, which then replies with the requested HTML document. It is the user's browser's job to read the HTML document and translate it into the site/content that is ultimately displayed on the user's screen. This Udacity <b><a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/e-48329854/m-48480496">video</a></b> provides a nice overview of the process. 

<b><p style = "font-size:18px">HTML</p></b>
HTML, or <em>Hypertext Markup Language</em>, is the language in which most of the content on the internet is written. There are a few components: <b>text content</b> (what we see), <b>markup</b> (what it looks like), <b>references to other documents</b> (such as images and videos), and <b>links to other pages</b>. See this Udacity <b><a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-48724340">video</a></b> for more details.

<b><p style = "font-size:18px">Coding in HTML</p></b>
Each HTML page is made up of any of a number of individual <b>elements</b>. These elements are defined using <b>tags</b>; as with elements, there is a huge variety in tags. Examples include the 'strong,' 'b,' and 'br.' The first two make text elements <b>bold</b> and the the third <em>breaks</em> the current paragraph and starts a new one. Once again, Udacity has a <b><a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-48723444">video</a></b> outlining these concepts. 

<b><p style = "font-size:18px">A Note on HTML Elements</p></b>
One important distinction between HTML elements is whether or not they are <b>block</b> or <b>inline</b>. Block elements are easiest to understand if you picture an invisible box or <em>block</em> being drawn around the content enclosed by a block tag. Block elements represent easy ways to help put structure around a page's text. The paragraph structure of this very page was built using the 'p,' or <em>paragraph</em> tag. Inline tags such as 'strong,' or 'em' have no impact on the organizational structure of the text, just the way it looks.

<b><p style = "font-size:18px">Non-Code Takeaways</p></b>
First, <em>computers are stupid</em>. It isn't a derogative term--it simply highlights the fact that computers do <b>exactly</b> what a user or programmer tells them to do. There is 0 room for creative interpretation by computers. While this makes their behavior predictable, it also leaves room for minor typos to have major impacts on the behavior of a program or website being coded.<br>
<br>

Second, and this is something I really appreciate, <em>it's okay to forget the details</em>. It's important to understand the underlying concepts and theory but Google (or Stack Overflow) are great resources for remembering the details of an individual tag or re-learning how to make something behave the way you want it to. There's simply too much for any one person to remember.
